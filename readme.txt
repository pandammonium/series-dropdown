Adds a new taxonomy called "series" to your blog that allows you to link together several posts in a series.

== Description ==

*Series Drop-down* is based on the Series plug-in by Justin Tadlock.  It allows users to easily link posts together by using a WordPress taxonomy (e.g. tags, categories) called "series".  It can be particularly useful if you write several posts spanning the same topic and want them tied together in some way.

*Series Drop-down* will automatically create archives for you and offers several ways to link your posts together.

Some features:

* A widget to list posts from a particular series either as an ordinary list or a drop-down list.
* A widget to list posts in the same series as the current post either as an ordinary list or a drop-down list.
* Several template tags for use within your theme.
* Two `taxonomy-series.php` templates for use with the WordPress Default theme and the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid theme framework">Hybrid theme</a>.
* Shortcodes to use within the post editor.
* And more!

**This plug-in is for WordPress 2.9.2 only.**

Full instructions for use can be found in the plug-in's `readme.html` file, which is included with the plug-in download.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why create this plug-in? =

I liked the Series plug-in by Justin Tadlock, but it only displayed series members in an ordinary list.  I wanted them to be displayed in a drop-down box, like my tags, categories and archives, to minimise space requirements.

= What does this plug-in do, exactly? =

It creates a new taxonomy called "series" for use on your site.  It gives you template tags, shortcodes, and widgets to allow you to more easily tie posts together in a series.

= What widgets are available to use? =

* Series: List Posts
* Series: Related Posts

= I don't understand any of this.  What should I do? =

You should do a little reading.  The `readme.html` file included with the plug-in has links to tons of resources.  Everything you need to know is there.
